## 📝 Description

Feathers is a fashion-oriented web application prototype created as a hands-on learning project for PHP development. It integrates dynamic PHP scripts with static HTML and CSS structures to build a simple online store layout, featuring dedicated pages for browsing, product details, and shopping cart management.

The application leverages standard PHP architecture, coordinating backend operations through core files like brain.php and admin.php while rendering user-facing components with cart.php and details.php. The entire project is packaged with a Dockerfile to ensure a consistent, self-contained development and runtime environment without manual server configuration.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🛒 Shopping Cart and Details** — Utilizes cart.php and details.php to simulate dynamic shopping cart operations and detailed item views.
- **🧠 Centralized Backend Logic** — Features dedicated scripts like brain.php and admin.php to manage administration and core business flows.
- **🐳 Dockerized Environment Support** — Includes a pre-configured Dockerfile to containerize the PHP application and its assets for easy deployment.
- **🎨 Styled Fashion Interface** — Features a custom CSS stylesheet and multiple pre-configured web-optimized images to display fashion merchandise.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Studying or practicing PHP backend web development using a practical, self-contained e-commerce project template.
- Quickly launching a local PHP and HTML development sandbox inside a lightweight Docker container.
